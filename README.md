13. There is a filter option where you can specify the number of stars you want to see based on different properties.
14. Quick note, after selecting a constellation group you may have to look around to see the constellation as it may not be facing the camera's original position.
15. Lastly, for certain options you may have a hard time seeing the stars due to their vast distance from the Earth. So we recommend inputing a large number for the star count when exploring these options.

Enjoy Exploring the Cosmos!!
